## Action game
A cross-platform 2D action game prototype that I made in 2014 using libgdx. In theory it should work on every platform supported by said library, however I tested it only on windows and android. 
The prototype consists in a single level in which the player must advance by fighting various groups of enemies.

I'm simply releasing the source code. The project isn't in development anymore.
